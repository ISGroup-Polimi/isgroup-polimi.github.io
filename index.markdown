# Research on Advanced Information Systems Engineering (RAISE)

The RAISE group researches in the area of Information Systems at the Politecnico di Milano on aspects related to the development of adaptive information systems, handling the various problems related to data management and processing, IS architectures, such as the impact of design choices in systems based on cloud / fog computing, data quality, data-centric AI, energy efficiency, big data and social media in different application contexts. In the area of design and management of adaptive information systems, the goal is the definition of information systems capable of dynamically evolving in order to meet specific requirements and maintain the system operations.
