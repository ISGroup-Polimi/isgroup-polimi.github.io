# The IS group activities in a nutshell 

Research in Information Systems at Politecnico di Milano concerns several aspects related to planning and conceptual and architectural design of information systems. Research focuses on initial design phases and corresponding high-level design issues, addressing the alignment between requirements and design solutions. The focus is on evaluating the impact of design choices, on using components at conceptual level for information systems design, on technological aspects of IS development. In particular the research of the group focuses on a number of specific research themes: design of adaptive information systems based on services, process modeling, information systems security, energy efficiency, risk and safety management, representation of spatial information and events, information quality, and sentiment analysis.

An overview of the areas, disciplines, and domains considered is shown in the following picture.</p>rnrnrn[caption id="attachment_291" align="aligncenter" width="339"]<img class=" wp-image-291" title="Research themes @ ISGroup" src="http://isgroup.dei.polimi.it/wp-content/uploads/stackricerca-982x1024.png" alt="" width="339" height="353" />
